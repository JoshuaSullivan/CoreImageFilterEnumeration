CoreImageFilterEnumeration
==========================

This project contains 2 targets: 

* First is a generator app that can create the enumerations for all of the Core Image filters.
* Second is a Framework combining all of the classes generated by the first app. 

If you just want to use the framework in your project, grab the CoreImageFilterEnumeration.framework object from the root directory of the Git repository and add it to your project in XCode.
